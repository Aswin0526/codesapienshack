Inference-

In computer vision, "inference" refers to the process of applying a trained machine learning model, 
typically a deep neural network, to new, unseen data to make predictions or extract meaningful information. 
The term "inference" is derived from the idea that the model is inferring the properties or labels of the 
input data based on what it has learned during the training phase
